Files containing the whole plasmid Nanopore sequencing reads.

1. array library: Contains reads from the gRNA array library generated via pooled PCA.
2. bulk plasmid sequencing: Contains reads from all the transformants (without blue-white screening/colony picking)
3. clonal plasmid sequencing: Contains reads from a single clonal plasmid.

Each directory contains the raw fastq files and the corresponding .pkl file of inserts which is generated by running this [script](../../scripts/get_plasmid_inserts.txt).

### Installing and using get_plasmid_inserts

Install:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/de-Boer-Lab/LabUtils.git
```

Installation of the package will create the command line executable
get_plasmid_inserts, which extracts inserts flanked by provided sequences
from whole plasmid Oxford Nanopore reads. See the
[LabUtils README](https://github.com/de-Boer-Lab/LabUtils) for more
information.
