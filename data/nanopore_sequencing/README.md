Files containing the whole plasmid Nanopore sequencing reads.

1. array library: Contains reads from the gRNA array library generated via pooled PCA.
2. bulk plasmid sequencing: Contains reads from all the transformants (without blue-white screening/colony picking)
3. clonal plasmid sequencing: COntains reads from a single clonal plasmid.

Each directory the fastq file and the corresponding .pkl file which is generated by running this [script].
